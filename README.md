This project uses a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model (via AUTOMATIC1111â€™s WebUI) on Google Colab to generate highly realistic portraits from text prompts. The specific focus here is on creating a photo-realistic portrait of a smiling woman in warm sunlight, using advanced generative AI techniques.
